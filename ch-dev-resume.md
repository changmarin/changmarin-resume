## 🧪 Summary

**Professional architect**, licensed to practice in Panama, with 15+ years of experience in BIM modeling and interoperability. Now transitioning into software development with a strong foundation in C#, .NET, and automation scripting. Passionate about building reusable tools, streamlining workflows, and crafting intuitive user experiences.

## 🏛️ Background

My journey began in architecture, where I helped establish a CAD environment for an architectural firm in Panama during the early days of digital adoption. This experience sparked a fascination with precision, modularity, and the power of well-structured systems—values that continue to guide my approach to software development.

## 💭Developer Philosophy

I began with a goal to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web development.  But discovering C# changed everything—I realized I could do more.  With a strong Python foundation, I quickly earned C# certification and embraced a broader vision.

I chose .NET not because it’s trendy, but because it aligns with how I think: modular, expressive, and cross-platform.  Blazor offered a modern alternative to JavaScript, and I’m glad I never invested heavily in JS.

This journey is about depth, not distraction.  I’m building reusable tools, exploring cloud integration, and crafting software that reflects clarity and purpose.
